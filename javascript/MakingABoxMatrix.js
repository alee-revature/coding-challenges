/* 1) This is based on Helen Yu's Making a Box challenge. 
This challenge is the same execpt that instead of an array of strings, your function should output a matrix of characters.

Examples
charBox(1) --> [
["#"]
]

charBox(4) --> [
["#", "#", "#", "#"],
["#", " ", " ", "#"],
["#", " ", " ", "#"],
["#", "#", "#", "#"]
]

charBox(2) --> [
["#", "#"],
["#", "#"]
]
Notes
As an added bonus, try making charBox(0) output [[]] and make any strings, non-integers, and negative numbers output -1.

Note:
A fraction is simplified if there are no common factors (except 1) between the numerator and the denominator. 
For example, 4/6 is not simplified, since 4 and 6 both share 2 as a factor.
